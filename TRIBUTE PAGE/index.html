                <P>Virat Kohli born 5 November 1988 is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India national
                    team. A right-handed top-order batsman, Kohli is regarded as one of the best contemporary batsmen in
                    the world.He plays for Delhi in domestic cricket and for Royal Challengers Bangalore in the Indian
                    Premier League (IPL) as captain of the franchise since 2013.</P><br>

                <P>Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the 2008 Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. After a few
                    months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri Lanka at the age of 19. Initially having
                    played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team, he soon established himself as a regular in the ODI
                    middle-order and was part of the squad that won the 2011 World Cup. He made his Test debut in 2011
                    and shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" by 2013 with Test hundreds in Australia and South
                    Africa.[4] Having reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time
                    in 2013,[5] Kohli also found success in the Twenty20 for mat, winning the Man of the Tournament
                    twice at the ICC World Twenty20 (in 2014 and 2016).
